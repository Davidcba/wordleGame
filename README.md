Instructions to run.

1. Run Npm install inside the project folder. (Node Version 20.10.0)
2. For running the API just execute npm run start. This will run the application on default port 3000 or whichever is assigned in the .env file.
3. By opening a browser on http://localhost:3000/ this will display the frontend. (Basic but works)
4. To execute the tests just run npm run test. The project is currently using JEST.
